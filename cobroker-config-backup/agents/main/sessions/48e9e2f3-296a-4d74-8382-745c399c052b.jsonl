Present a structured plan, wait for approval, then execute all steps sequentially.\n\n## 1. When to Enter Plan Mode\n\n**Enter plan mode** when the user's request contains **2 or more distinct operations**:\n\n- \"Add population and income demographics\" → 2 ops (2 demographic calls) → **plan**\n- \"Research zoning and add median income\" → 2 ops (enrichment + demographics) → **plan**\n- \"Create a project, add demographics, and research zoning\" → 3 ops → **plan**\n- \"Add population, income, and home value demographics\" → 3 ops → **plan**\n\n**Do NOT enter plan mode** for single operations (execute directly via cobroker-projects):\n\n- \"Add population demographics\" → 1 op → **execute directly**\n- \"What's the zoning for my properties?\" → 1 enrichment → **execute directly**\n- \"List my projects\" → 1 op → **execute directly**\n- \"Create a project with 5 addresses\" → 1 op (even with multiple properties)\n\n**Rule of thumb:** Count the number of separate API calls needed. If it's 2+, plan. If it's 1, just do it.\n\n## 2. Available Step Types\n\nEvery plan step maps to a cobroker-projects endpoint:\n\n| Step Type | Endpoint | Credits | Sync/Async |\n|-----------|----------|---------|------------|\n| `create-project` | POST /projects (Section 3) | 1/address (geocoding) | Sync |\n| `add-properties` | POST /projects/{id}/properties (Section 5) | 1/address | Sync |\n| `update-project` | PATCH /projects/{id} (Section 4) | 0 | Sync |\n| `update-properties` | PATCH /projects/{id}/properties (Section 6) | 0 (re-geocode: 1/addr) | Sync |\n| `delete-properties` | DELETE /projects/{id}/properties (Section 7) | 0 | Sync |\n| `delete-project` | DELETE /projects/{id} (Section 8) | 0 | Sync |\n| `demographics` | POST /projects/{id}/demographics (Section 9) | 4/property | Sync |\n| `enrichment` | POST /projects/{id}/enrichment (Section 11) | 1-30/property | **Async** |\n| `check-enrichment` | GET /projects/{id}/enrichment (Section 12) | 0 | Sync |\n| `list-projects` | GET /projects (Section 1) | 0 | Sync |\n| `get-details` | GET /projects/{id} (Section 2) | 0 | Sync |\n\n## 3. Plan Format\n\nPresent the plan as a structured message:\n\n```\n📝 Plan: [Short Title]\n\n[1-2 sentence description of what we'll do]\n\nSteps:\n1. [Operation description] — [type tag]\n2. [Operation description] — [type tag]\n3. [Operation description] — [type tag]\n\nEstimated credits: [X] credits total\n[Any notes about async operations or timing]\n\nReply \"go\" to execute, or tell me what to change.\n```\n\nAlways attach inline keyboard buttons after the plan message (see Section 5).\n\n### Credit Calculation\n\n- Demographics: 4 credits × number of properties\n- Enrichment: credits depend on processor (base=1, core=3, pro=10, ultra=30) × number of properties\n- Create/add properties: 1 credit per address (geocoding)\n- Updates, deletes, lists: 0 credits\n\n## 4. Plan Examples\n\n### Example A — Demographics + Enrichment\n\n```\n📝 Plan: Enrich Dallas Warehouses\n\nI'll add demographic data and research zoning for your Dallas Warehouses project (12 properties).\n\nSteps:\n1. Add Population (1 mi radius) — demographics\n2. Add Median Household Income (1 mi radius) — demographics\n3. Research Zoning Classification (base processor) — enrichment\n\nEstimated credits: 108 (48 demographics + 48 demographics + 12 enrichment)\nNote: Enrichment results arrive async (15-100s per property).\n\nReply \"go\" to execute, or tell me what to change.\n```\n\n### Example B — Create + Enrich (full workflow)\n\n```\n📝 Plan: New Austin Retail Survey\n\nI'll create a new project with your 8 addresses, then add demographics and research competitors.\n\nSteps:\n1. Create project \"Austin Retail\" with 8 properties — create-project\n2. Add Population (1 mi radius) — demographics\n3. Add Median Household Income (1 mi radius) — demographics\n4. Add Median Home Value (1 mi radius) — demographics\n5. Research \"nearby competing retail stores\" (base) — enrichment\n\nEstimated credits: 168 (8 geocoding + 96 demographics + 8 enrichment)\n\nReply \"go\" to execute, or tell me what to change.\n```\n\n### Example C — Modify + Remove\n\n```\n📝 Plan: Clean Up Dallas Warehouses\n\nI'll update the project details and remove the properties you flagged.\n\nSteps:\n1. Rename project to \"Dallas Warehouses — Q2 Final\" — update-project\n2. Remove 3 properties (IDs: abc, def, ghi) — delete-properties\n3. Update asking price on 123 Main St to $650K — update-properties\n\nEstimated credits: 0\n\nReply \"go\" to execute, or tell me what to change.\n```\n\n### Example D — Multiple Enrichment Columns\n\n```\n📝 Plan: Deep Research — TopGolf El Paso\n\nI'll research multiple attributes for your TopGolf El Paso project (1 property).\n\nSteps:\n1. Research Zoning Classification (base) — enrichment\n2. Research Year Built & Building Size (base) — enrichment\n3. Research Recent Sale History (core) — enrichment\n4. Add Population (3 mi drive time) — demographics\n\nEstimated credits: 10 (2 base enrichment + 3 core enrichment + 4 demographics)\nNote: Enrichment results arrive async. Base: ~15-100s, Core: ~1-5min.\n\nReply \"go\" to execute, or tell me what to change.\n```\n\n## 5. Inline Keyboard for Approval\n\nAfter presenting the plan, attach an inline keyboard with three buttons:\n\n```\nbuttons: [\n  [\n    { text: \"✅ Approve & Execute\", callback_data: \"plan_approve\" },\n    { text: \"✏️ Edit Plan\", callback_data: \"plan_edit\" }\n  ],\n  [\n    { text: \"❌ Cancel\", callback_data: \"plan_cancel\" }\n  ]\n]\n```\n\n**How callback flow works:**\n1. You send the plan message with the `buttons` parameter\n2. User clicks a button → gateway receives callback_query\n3. Gateway forwards the callback_data as a new text message to you\n4. You receive `\"plan_approve\"`, `\"plan_edit\"`, or `\"plan_cancel\"` as the next user message\n5. Act accordingly (see Section 6)\n\n## 6. Handling Callbacks\n\nWhen you receive a message that matches a callback or text equivalent:\n\n### Approve\n- **Callback:** `plan_approve`\n- **Text equivalents:** \"go\", \"yes\", \"approved\", \"proceed\", \"execute\", \"do it\", \"run it\"\n- **Action:** Execute all plan steps sequentially (see Section 7)\n\n### Edit\n- **Callback:** `plan_edit`\n- **Action:** Reply \"What would you like to change?\" and wait for feedback. After receiving feedback, revise the plan and re-present it with the same inline keyboard buttons.\n\n### Cancel\n- **Callback:** `plan_cancel`\n- **Text equivalents:** \"cancel\", \"nevermind\", \"stop\", \"nah\", \"no\"\n- **Action:** Reply \"Plan cancelled. Send me a new request anytime.\" and stop.\n\n### Other text\n- If you're waiting for plan approval and the user sends text that isn't a clear approve/cancel, treat it as **plan edit feedback** — revise the plan based on their input and re-present with buttons.\n\n## 7. Execution Flow\n\nAfter approval:\n\n1. Send a \"⚡ Starting plan execution...\" message\n2. Execute each step **in order** using the cobroker-projects skill endpoints (curl commands)\n3. Report progress after each step:\n   ```\n   ✅ Step 1/3: Population (1 mi) — done (12 properties enriched)\n   ⏳ Step 2/3: Median Income (1 mi) — running...\n   ```\n4. For async operations (enrichment), submit and note it's processing:\n   ```\n   ✅ Step 3/3: Zoning enrichment submitted (12 properties, base processor)\n   Results will appear in the project table shortly.\n   ```\n5. After all steps complete, send a summary:\n   ```\n   ✅ Plan complete!\n\n   - Population (1 mi): 12/12 properties ✓\n   - Median Income (1 mi): 12/12 properties ✓\n   - Zoning research: submitted, processing...\n\n   View project: [publicUrl]\n   ```\n\n## 8. Step Ordering Rules\n\nAlways order steps logically, regardless of the order the user mentioned them:\n\n1. **Create/update operations first** — create project, add properties, update project\n2. **Demographics next** — synchronous, fast (~1-2s per property)\n3. **Enrichment last** — async, takes longer (15s to 25min)\n4. **Destructive operations at the end** — delete properties, delete project\n\nThis ensures:\n- Properties exist before enrichment runs\n- Fast operations complete before slow ones\n- The user sees progress quickly\n\n## 9. Error Handling\n\n- **Step fails (non-credit):** Report the error and **continue** with remaining steps\n- **Credit failure (402):** **Stop** execution immediately — don't waste remaining credits on steps that will also fail\n- **At the end:** Summarize what succeeded and what failed\n\n### Error Examples\n\nPartial failure (continue):\n```\n✅ Step 1/3: Population (1 mi) — done (12/12)\n❌ Step 2/3: Median Income (1 mi) — failed (server error)\n✅ Step 3/3: Zoning enrichment submitted (12 properties)\n\nPlan partially complete: 2/3 steps succeeded. Step 2 failed — you can retry \"add median income demographics\" separately.\n```\n\nCredit failure (stop):\n```\n✅ Step 1/3: Population (1 mi) — done (12/12)\n❌ Step 2/3: Median Income — failed (insufficient credits: need 48, have 30)\n⏭️ Step 3/3: Skipped (insufficient credits)\n\nPlan stopped at step 2. Step 1 completed successfully. Add credits and retry.\n```\n\n## 10. Dependencies Between Steps\n\nSome steps depend on outputs from earlier steps:\n\n- **Create project → demographics/enrichment:** The create-project step returns a `projectId`. Use that ID for all subsequent demographics and enrichment calls in the same plan.\n- **Add properties → enrichment:** Properties must exist (with coordinates) before demographics can run, and must have addresses before enrichment can run.\n- **Enrichment → check status:** After submitting enrichment, you can optionally poll once after ~30s to report early results. But don't block the plan waiting for async completion.\n\nWhen a plan includes `create-project` as step 1, capture the `projectId` from the response and pass it to all subsequent steps.\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770780849081}}

Add Demographics to Project\n\nEnrich properties with ESRI demographic data. Creates a new column and populates values for all properties with coordinates.\n\n```bash\ncurl -s -X POST \"$COBROKER_BASE_URL/api/agent/openclaw/projects/{projectId}/demographics\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"X-Agent-User-Id: $COBROKER_AGENT_USER_ID\" \\\n  -H \"X-Agent-Secret: $COBROKER_AGENT_SECRET\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"dataType\": \"population\",\n    \"radius\": 1,\n    \"mode\": \"radius\"\n  }'\n```\n\nParameters:\n- `dataType` (required) — demographic metric (see Section 10 for full list)\n- `radius` (required) — 0.1 to 100 (miles for radius, minutes for drive/walk)\n- `mode` (optional, default `\"radius\"`) — `\"radius\"` | `\"drive\"` | `\"walk\"`\n- `columnName` (optional) — auto-generated if omitted (e.g. \"Population (1 mi)\")\n\nResponse:\n```json\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"projectId\": \"uuid\",\n  \"columnId\": \"uuid\",\n  \"columnName\": \"Population (1 mi)\",\n  \"dataType\": \"population\",\n  \"radius\": 1,\n  \"mode\": \"radius\",\n  \"propertiesProcessed\": 5,\n  \"propertiesTotal\": 5,\n  \"propertiesFailed\": 0\n}\n```\n\nCommon data types:\n| Type | Description |\n|------|-------------|\n| `population` | Total population |\n| `income` | Median household income |\n| `median_age` | Median age |\n| `households` | Total households |\n| `median_home_value` | Median home value |\n| `median_rent` | Median rent |\n| `retail_jobs` | Retail employment |\n| `healthcare_jobs` | Healthcare employment |\n\nCost: 4 credits per property per demographic column.\n\n## 10. List Demographic Types\n\n```bash\ncurl -s -X GET \"$COBROKER_BASE_URL/api/agent/openclaw/projects/{projectId}/demographics\" \\\n  -H \"X-Agent-User-Id: $COBROKER_AGENT_USER_ID\" \\\n  -H \"X-Agent-Secret: $COBROKER_AGENT_SECRET\"\n```\n\nReturns all 58 supported data types grouped by category: Core Demographics, Income Brackets, Race/Ethnicity, Age Groups, Employment, Housing & Additional.\n\n## 11. Research Enrichment (AI-Powered)\n\nUse Parallel AI to research a question about each property. Creates a new column and submits async research tasks. Results arrive via webhook (15s to 25min depending on processor).\n\n```bash\ncurl -s -X POST \"$COBROKER_BASE_URL/api/agent/openclaw/projects/{projectId}/enrichment\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -H \"X-Agent-User-Id: $COBROKER_AGENT_USER_ID\" \\\n  -H \"X-Agent-Secret: $COBROKER_AGENT_SECRET\" \\\n  -d '{\n    \"prompt\": \"What is the zoning classification for this property?\",\n    \"columnName\": \"Zoning\",\n    \"processor\": \"base\"\n  }'\n```\n\nParameters:\n- `prompt` (required) — question to research for each property address\n- `columnName` (optional) — auto-generated from prompt if omitted\n- `processor` (optional, default `\"base\"`) — research depth:\n  - `\"base\"` — 1 credit/property, ~15-100s\n  - `\"core\"` — 3 credits/property, ~1-5min\n  - `\"pro\"` — 10 credits/property, ~3-9min\n  - `\"ultra\"` — 30 credits/property, ~5-25min\n\nResponse (202 Accepted):\n```json\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"projectId\": \"uuid\",\n  \"columnId\": \"uuid\",\n  \"columnName\": \"Zoning\",\n  \"prompt\": \"What is the zoning classification for this property?\",\n  \"processor\": \"base\",\n  \"propertiesSubmitted\": 5,\n  \"propertiesTotal\": 5,\n  \"propertiesSkipped\": 0,\n  \"creditsCharged\": 5,\n  \"status\": \"processing\",\n  \"estimatedTime\": \"15-100 seconds per property (base processor)\"\n}\n```\n\n## 12. Check Enrichment Status\n\nPoll to check if enrichment tasks have completed.\n\n```bash\ncurl -s -X GET \"$COBROKER_BASE_URL/api/agent/openclaw/projects/{projectId}/enrichment?columnId={columnId}\" \\\n  -H \"X-Agent-User-Id: $COBROKER_AGENT_USER_ID\" \\\n  -H \"X-Agent-Secret: $COBROKER_AGENT_SECRET\"\n```\n\nResponse:\n```json\n{\n  \"success\": true,\n  \"columnId\": \"uuid\",\n  \"columnName\": \"Zoning\",\n  \"status\": \"processing\",\n  \"completed\": 3,\n  \"pending\": 1,\n  \"failed\": 1,\n  \"total\": 5,\n  \"results\": [\n    {\n      \"propertyId\": \"uuid\",\n      \"address\": \"123 Main St, Dallas, TX 75201\",\n      \"status\": \"completed\",\n      \"content\": \"C-2 Commercial\",\n      \"confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"propertyId\": \"uuid\",\n      \"address\": \"456 Oak Ave, Dallas, TX 75202\",\n      \"status\": \"pending\",\n      \"content\": null,\n      \"confidence\": null\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Address Formatting — CRITICAL\n\nAddresses MUST have at least 3 comma-separated components:\n\n- GOOD: `\"123 Main St, Dallas, TX 75201\"` ← street, city, state+zip\n- GOOD: `\"123 Main St, Suite 100, Dallas, TX 75201\"`\n- BAD: `\"123 Main St Dallas TX 75201\"` ← no commas, rejected\n- BAD: `\"123 Main St, Dallas TX 75201\"` ← only 2 parts, rejected\n\nIf the user gives an address without proper commas, reformat it before submitting.\n\n## Workflow Guidelines\n\n1. **User wants to see their projects** → List Projects (Section 1)\n2. **User wants details on a project** → Get Project Details (Section 2)\n3. **User provides new properties** → Create Project (Section 3) if new, or Add Properties (Section 5) if adding to existing\n4. **User wants to rename/update a project** → Update Project (Section 4)\n5. **User wants to change a property** → Update Properties (Section 6) — get property IDs from details first\n6. **User wants to remove properties** → Delete Properties (Section 7)\n7. **User wants to delete a project** → Delete Project (Section 8) — confirm with user first\n8. **User asks for demographic data** → Add Demographics (Section 9) — properties must exist first\n9. **User asks what demographics are available** → List Demographic Types (Section 10)\n10. **User asks to research something about properties** → Research Enrichment (Section 11), then poll status (Section 12) until completed\n11. **User asks about enrichment status** → Check Enrichment Status (Section 12)\n\n## Constraints\n\n- Maximum 50 properties per request (create or add)\n- NEVER fabricate addresses — only import what the user provides or what research found\n- Each geocoded address costs 1 credit (automatic if lat/long omitted)\n- If geocoding fails for some properties, they still import (without map pins)\n- Always create projects as `\"public\": true` so the URL can be shared via Telegram\n- Always share the **publicUrl** with the user (not projectUrl)\n- Demographics require properties with coordinates — add properties first, then enrich\n- Each demographic column costs 4 credits per property (ESRI GeoEnrichment API)\n- Properties without lat/long are skipped during demographic enrichment\n- Each enrichment costs 1-30 credits per property depending on processor (base=1, core=3, pro=10, ultra=30)\n- Enrichment is **async** — submit first, then poll for results. Tell the user \"researching...\" and check back.\n- Properties need addresses (not coordinates) for enrichment — unlike demographics which need coordinates\n- Default to `\"base\"` processor unless user asks for deeper research\n- After enrichment completes, results appear as a new column in the project table\n"}],"isError":false,"timestamp":1770780849086}}
